You will learn how to meditate from a professional and you can keep your fitness watch at the conclusion of the study.


### I submitted my interest to the study, what’s next?

We will reach out to you as soon as possible to schedule a zoom info info/consent session. We will use this time to answer questions and obtain your consent to continue with enrollment next-steps. Due to large enrollment, it may take some time for our team to review all potential participants. 


# Active Study Participants:


### What if I forget to wear my Fitbit for a day?

No worries, if you forget to wear the Fitbit for a day, or several, it will have no significant bearing on your participation in the study.


### What if I forget to meditate for a day?

No worries, if you forget to meditate for a day, it will have no significant bearing on your participation in the study. Please contact us if this extends for longer than one day.


### What does my participant ID mean?

Your participant ID takes the following form: ###-##-#. The first 3 digits are your personal identifier, the following 2 digits are your cohort, and the final digit is which arm you are assigned.

### What surveys will I be receiving?

You will receive links from two different sources: Gorilla and Redcap. If you do not receive a survey please check your spam folder before contacting our team.


# Fitbit:


### Do I need to charge my Fitbit?

We recommend that you charge your fitbit every 3-5 days for best results.


### Do I need to download the FitBit App?

We recommend that you download the Fitbit app to track your data. While not necessary, it will allow you to gain access to advanced health metrics!


### How do you get my data from my Fitbit?

We use the myPHD app [https://myphd.stanford.edu/](https://myphd.stanford.edu/) to package and collect your data.


### How does the myPHD access code work?

After downloading the myPHD app, please download and click the myPHD key file on your mobile device. The code should automatically connect to the myPHD app. If the myPHD key does not automatically connect, please contact our study coordinator.

Do I need to sync my Fitbit daily?

We ask that you open the app at least once weekly to sync. The manual sync is not required in most circumstances.

My Fitbit irritates my skin when I wear it constantly. What should I do?

We recommend that you wear your Fitbit nightly. If you choose to wear your Fitbit 24/7, we recommend that you loosen the watch and possibly switch arms every few days. Constant use of a wearable device can cause irritation to skin over time if not properly adjusted, the band is not regularly cleaned, or the wearer has a skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis.
